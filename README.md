# üßë‚Äçüíª About Me:
I'm a final-year Computer Science student at VIT Vellore with a genuine interest in building software that actually works and solves problems people care about. I've got a solid grasp of DSA fundamentals and work primarily with Java, while currently diving deeper into Spring Boot for backend development.

Over the past few years, I've built several full-stack projects that taught me how to handle everything from initial planning to getting something live and running. Right now, I'm focused on getting better with backend technologies - Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, REST APIs, and learning about microservices architecture.

I like tackling new challenges because they usually teach me something I didn't know before. I do well in environments where I'm constantly learning and pushing myself to figure out new things. When I'm not coding, you'll find me analyzing cricket matches, listening to music, or binge-watching American sitcoms.

I'm looking to connect with other developers and mentors in the tech space, and I'm interested in opportunities where I can contribute what I know while continuing to grow as a software engineer
